LibBcm2835.Net
==============

This library is now deprecated. I advice that you use .NET Core and System.Device.Gpio from now on ;-)

Description
-----------

A .NET/Mono Wrapper for Mike McCauley's C library for Broadcom BCM 2835 as used in Raspberry Pi  
( http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/index.html )

Intended as a C#/.NET/Mono wrapper for the full functionality of that library.  

It already contains the bcm2835-1.xx.tar.gz file, it will try to extract and compile the library on first use. 
You can also supply your own libbcm2835.so file (just put it next to the dll on your target system). Make sure it's the same version as the one included here.


How to get started?
-------------------

* Install Mono on your Raspberry Pi. (with the commands below)
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mono-complete
```
* Compile the sample Blink project (Using Visual Studio, Mono Develop or mcs).
* Copy the output directory (at least Blink.exe and LibBcm2835.dll) to your Raspberry Pi.  
* Run Blink.exe (with the command below)
```
sudo mono Blink.exe
```

Example
-------
This is based on the original blink.c.
```C#
// Blinks on RPi Plug P1 pin 7 (which is GPIO 4)
const Byte pin = (byte)Bcm2835.RPiGPIOPin.RPI_V2_GPIO_P1_07;

// Will extract (from embedded resource) and compile the library 
// if it doesn't exist in the same directory as LibBcm2835.dll.
Bcm2835.ExtractAndCompileLibraryIfNotExists();

// Grabbing the instance will dynamically load the libbcm2835.so 
// library, so make sure it's there before accessing this property.
Bcm2835 bcm2835 = Bcm2835.Instance;

// If you call this, it will not actually access the GPIO
// Use for testing
// bcm2835.bcm2835_set_debug(1);

if (bcm2835.bcm2835_init() == 0)
  return 1;

// Set the pin to be an output
bcm2835.bcm2835_gpio_fsel(pin, Bcm2835.HIGH);

while (true)
{
  // Turn it on
  bcm2835.bcm2835_gpio_write(pin, Bcm2835.HIGH);

  // wait a bit
  bcm2835.bcm2835_delay(500);

  // turn it off
  bcm2835.bcm2835_gpio_write(pin, Bcm2835.LOW);

  // wait a bit
  bcm2835.bcm2835_delay(500);
}
```

Notice
------
I only tested this on Raspbian. I assume it works on other distributions as well.
I will accept Pull Requests to make it (more) compatible with other distributions.
